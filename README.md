## Hello Arduino

### Discription
Our first Arduino project was making an LED blink.

### Image
Don't know what I should put here

### Evidence
[LED blink code](https://create.arduino.cc/editor/zsiller38/645f63f4-a05e-46d7-808e-a8b659a936dc/preview)

### Reflection
I really enjoyed this project it was confusing at first but I feal like I understand what each line of code does. I am really looking forward to the finite light blinker. I am still wondering if there is anyway I can have the arduino pluged into my computer but not have the code running.
