## Hello Arduino

### Discription
Our first Arduino project was making an LED blink.

### Reflection
I really enjoyed this project it was confusing at first but I feal like I understand what each line of code does. I am really looking forward to the finite light blinker. I am still wondering if there is anyway I can have the arduino pluged into my computer but not have the code running.

## Finite Light Blinker

### Discription
Our goal was to write a code to make an LED blink for a set number of times.

### Reflection
I really enjoyed making counters to count how many times an LED blinks and using if statments to get the LED to stop blinking or continue blinking. I did need some help from my dad in this project. I also like that the LED will not contnue to blink forever.

## Variable Light Blinker

### Description
This project was to make a code that would make a light blink for 2 seconds the 1.8 1.6 ectetera all the way down to .2 seconds.

### Reflection
I found this project rather easy and I did learn some new stuff like Delay Var. Most of the project was just substituting Delay Var into diffrent parts of the code, so I did not think it was that interesting.

## 1 Button 1 LED

### Description
Pushing one button turns on an LED pushing it again turns it off.

### Reflection
The button and LED was a cool project because we learned how to use buttons. It was this project that really taught me a lot about one of the big parts of coding, if statements. I also learned a lot about digitale read and how you can read the button state.

## 2 Button 2 LED

### Description
One button makes one LED blink another button makes a different LED blink.

### Reflection
2 buttons 2 LEDs was essentially 1 button 1 led with some new code and circit. It was a pretty easy project because there were not any new code components. I did have some truoble because I did not have enough resistors but it worked out.

## Button Servo

### Description
Make a servo to right by pushing one button and left by pushing another.

### Reflection
Button servo was my favorite project so far and I am very exited to start mouting it.
