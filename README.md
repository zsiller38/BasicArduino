## Hello Arduino

### Discription
Our first Arduino project was making an LED blink.

### Reflection
I really enjoyed this project it was confusing at first but I feal like I understand what each line of code does. I am really looking forward to the finite light blinker. I am still wondering if there is anyway I can have the arduino pluged into my computer but not have the code running.

## Finite Light Blinker

### Discription
Our goal was to write a code to make an LED blink for a set number of times.

### Reflection
I really enjoyed making counters to count how many times an LED blinks and using if statments to get the LED to stop blinking or continue blinking. I did need some help from my dad in this project. I also like that the LED will not contnue to blink forever.
